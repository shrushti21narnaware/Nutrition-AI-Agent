# Nutrition-AI-Agent
"NutriHolo" is an AI Agent  where it helps user with best healthy food choices.

An AI-powered virtual nutritionist designed to deliver personalized, adaptive, and culturally aware dietary guidance. Built using IBM Cloud Lite and IBM Granite Foundation Model, this assistant leverages generative AI to understand user inputs, generate dynamic meal plans, and provide contextual nutritional advice tailored to individual health needs.


## 🧩 Problem Statement

Despite rising health awareness, most nutrition tools offer generic advice, ignoring individual
differences in lifestyle, culture, allergies, and evolving health conditions. Dieticians struggle to
scale personalized consultations due to time and resource constraints. There’s a pressing need for
a scalable, intelligent solution that delivers real-time, personalized nutrition guidance

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Develop an AI-powered virtual nutrition assistant using generative AI, NLP, and multimodal
understanding, hosted on IBM Cloud Lite and powered by IBM Granite. The assistant will:
● Accept inputs via text, voice, and image (e.g., food photos, grocery labels)
● Generate dynamic, personalized meal plans based on health goals, medical conditions,
fitness routines, and preferences
